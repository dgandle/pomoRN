###### An elegant productivity timer, built in React Native.

### About
The [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a productivity method which breaks down work into short, 25-minute chunks with 5-minute breaks between. **Pomo.** is a lightweight and extremely minimal timer which follows the Pomodoro technique 25/5 structure. There are many other Pomodoro timers available on the app store, but they're often buggy or suffer from feature bloat.

**Pomo.** was created as a hobby project so I could learn React Native, from initial app creeation through to public release. It can be found on both the [App Store]() and [Google Play Store](). _TODO: Add links._

### Known Issues
- On Android, the "Resume" button does not fade out.
